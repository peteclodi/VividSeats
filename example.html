  <body>
    <p>Welcome!</p>
    <p>Thanks for taking our coding challenge!  We'd like for you to implement a basic event management system 
      using the provided VividSeats.eventService API, and the wireframes at:  <a target="wireframe" href="http://app.mockflow.com/view/bd9d29995b2e320c0ac0d1f5edb15a39">http://app.mockflow.com/view/bd9d29995b2e320c0ac0d1f5edb15a39</a>
    </p>
    <p> The basic features should include:
      <ul>
        <li>Display events (event name, date, venue name, city, state) in list/tabular format</li>
        <li>Display groupings of events (by city, or by date)</li>
        <li>Edit events</li>
        <li>Add events</li>
        <li>Remove Events</li>
      </ul>
      Please refer to the wireframes for a rough idea of what we're looking for.  Feel free to take creative liberties, however please ensure you cover the core features requested.  You may use any open source javascript frameworks (we use Angular, but we're open to anything for this challenge) or libraries you like.
      Also, if Plunker is giving you problems, feel free to port to github or another tool of your choosing.
      </p>
      <p>
      You're welcome to take as much time as you like, however don't feel you need to spend more than 2-3 hours on this.  Better to build half a product than a bad product.
    </p>
    <p>Thanks, and enjoy!</p>
